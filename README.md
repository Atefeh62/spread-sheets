# spread-sheets
1. In these googlesheet and excel online link I have a dirty data which I cleand in both googlesheet and excel, everything from erasing empty rows, blank cells, deleting duplicated data, transposing data from long to wide, using changecase in googlesheet to makeup the upper/lowercase, at the end I cleard the formatting so that my data would be easily readale.
