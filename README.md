1. In these googlesheet and excel online link I have a dirty data which I cleand in both googlesheet and excel, everything from erasing empty rows, blank cells, deleting duplicated data, transposing data from long to wide, using changecase in googlesheet to makeup the upper/lowercase, at the end I cleard the formatting so that my data would be easily readale.

3.In this spread sheet I have a data set of cosmetic products, in 2 different sheets,each product have a code and the price and the total sale of each product, in other sheet we have the name of the products whith the code of each product, what I have done, is to male a pivot table which shoes the total sale and the code of each product, sort it as descending to see the most profitable items.I used VLOOKUP function to bring the name of each product into the first sheet which has all the information except the name of the products. I also made a chatrt of the price and in that chart I saw a product has a wierd amount under 1 $ so I guessed it must be 7.3 and fixed it.

4.In this spreadsheet I have a dataset, and start cleaning it by removing duplicates, the rating must be under 5 so I determine the values more than 5, by first knowing if there is such data by =COUNTIF and then I sort the data by descending from the column Rating, and then I decide what to do with that(here I replaced them with 5), and seprate the  lat-long, also made the longtitude minus to be valid to read:

5. In the link bellow I simply. combined columns with first name and last name in to a new column named "Full Name", using CONCAT function, and combined 3 othr columns with Day, Month and Year, in a column named Date, using CONCATENATE function and also put "-"in between them to hame a better format of the date:

6. In the link bellow I am working on "DATA VALIDATION" while a project is being done I added a dropdown list, with 3 options "not started yet", "Ã¯n progress", "done", in a seprate column named "status". and also in othe column I added a checkbox with "approved", and "not approved" options. I also used "CONDITIONAL FORMATTING" to make our data more clear, and fill the cell with sot started yed value with red color, in progress with yellow color, and done with green color, we can use the data validation function to put a rule people just can fill valid data, for example in my spread sheet bellow I put the rule date to make sure it is all in a same date format. at the end if the date ids a date after today I put another formatting rule to paint it orange:
