1. In these googlesheet and excel online link I have a dirty data which I cleand in both googlesheet and excel, everything from erasing empty rows, blank cells, deleting duplicated data, transposing data from long to wide, using changecase in googlesheet to makeup the upper/lowercase, at the end I cleard the formatting so that my data would be easily readale.

3.In this spread sheet I have a data set of cosmetic products, in 2 different sheets,each product have a code and the price and the total sale of each product, in other sheet we have the name of the products whith the code of each product, what I have done, is to male a pivot table which shoes the total sale and the code of each product, sort it as descending to see the most profitable items.I used VLOOKUP function to bring the name of each product into the first sheet which has all the information except the name of the products. I also made a chatrt of the price and in that chart I saw a product has a wierd amount under 1 $ so I guessed it must be 7.3 and fixed it.

4.In this spreadsheet I have a dataset, and start cleaning it by removing duplicates, the rating must be under 5 so I determine the values more than 5, by first knowing if there is such data by =COUNTIF and then I sort the data by descending from the column Rating, and then I decide what to do with that(here I replaced them with 5), and seprate the  lat-long, also made the longtitude minus to be valid to read:
